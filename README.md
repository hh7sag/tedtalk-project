## Overview
TED Talk stands for Technology, Entertainment and Design, which provides media platform for speakers with different backgrounds to speak about macro-level topics. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle website(www.kaggle.com), which has 17 columns and 2550 videos which have 2 datasets for overview data and transcript data. In this project, I only focus on the overview data
