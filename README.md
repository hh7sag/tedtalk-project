# tedtalk-project
Ted Talk videos dataset is a project which I love to dig down since there are lots of videos with different emotions across the website. This project is mainly created using Google Colaboratory writing in Python language

## Overview
TED Talk stands for Technology, Entertainment and Design, which provides media platform for speakers with different backgrounds to speak about macro-level topics. For me, it has tremendous sources to improve my English listening skills a lot when I was young. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle website (www.kaggle.com), which has 17 columns and 2550 videos which have 2 datasets for overview data and transcript data. In this project, I only focus on the overview data

## Problem Statement
There are 3 questions needed to be discussed during the project:
1. Big Question: What factors make a good/bad quality TED Talk? 
-> Figure out criteria for good/bad quality video on Youtube: rating/view columns,views, comments, timestamps
2. Big Question: What topics appear the most in top good/bad quality videos?
-> Figure out top topics that cover the good/bad quality
3. Big Question: What emotional rating represents TED videos with positive and negative ratings?
-> Figure out top emotional ratings appearing in top good/ bad quality videos
